# OperatingPlatforms
A sample of a Software Design Document developed during the course of CS-230 Operating Platforms
The client for this design was The Gaming Room. The client wanted to expand the reach of their game "Draw It or Lose It" by making it web-based and accessible from different devices over different operating systems.
I think I did well in identifying the requirements for different aspects of development.
The design document was a helpful resource for developing the program as a quick reference for key details and to pinpoint important requirements to address. 
Improvements that I would make to this document would be to include more details in the final recommendation to the client with more specific language.
The user's experience is paramount in an application like "Draw It or Lose It" because it is an application designed for the consumer. If a gaming application is difficult to use or does not run well, people will not use it. 
When designing this software I was conscious of the client and user's needs, as well as the overall desired results. In the future when designing software for a client I woud like to be mindful of cost and system requirements.
